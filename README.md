 Hi there, I'm Elikanah Njuru — @elikanah8

I'm a passionate and curious **software development student** currently in my 3rd year of IT studies. I'm on a journey to master **Python** and **C++**, my two favorite languages, as I build my way toward becoming a skilled developer.

I'm especially interested in:
- Writing clean, efficient code
- Building real-world projects
- Exploring data structures, algorithms, and system design

Currently:
- Learning and growing every day
- Working on academic and personal projects
- Building a solid foundation in software development
